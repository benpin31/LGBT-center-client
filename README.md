# LGBT CENTER APP

Centre LGBTQI+ is an association that has been fighting for equal rights and against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity for more than 20 years.
They welcome, inform and offer support by providing activities and documentary resources on LGBT issues. They get about 15000 (fifteen thousand) visitors per year in their Paris office.

Like many NGOs they rely on donations. For that reason they need to keep track of how many people come and what kind of assistance is provided. With these records they’re able to :
- Demonstrate which of their activities is most requested.
- Adjust existing activities to keep up with the current context and demand.

Until today the system to keep track of visits was kinda prehistoric with a simple piece of paper being stashed in a drawer at the end of each day. 
At the end of the year a really brave employee picks up the mountain of paper and starts counting.

We met with employees to try and figure out what they actually needed. We ended up with 3 main needs:
- Build a simple tool for the volunteers to keep track of visits.
- Allow admins to access and modify data.
- Provide insights on the association activities.

With these informations in hands we went to work!
